# sleep_puberty_affect_associations

These scripts first wrangle pubertal, demo, and sleep data.  

Aim 1: To characterize the associations between pubertal stage and daily objective and subjective sleep quality assessments. To measure subjective sleep quality, we obtained daily self-reported measures of sleep duration and sleep satisfaction through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). To measure objective sleep quality, we examined sleep duration and sleep efficiency (i.e., the proportion of total sleep time to time-in-bed) metrics from daily actigraphy.

Aim 2: To investigate the moderating effects of advanced pubertal stage on the daily association between sleep quality and affect.
